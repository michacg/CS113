note for michelle:

when exporting from maya
*select all bones and model
*export in fbx 2012
*export all animation

things to do when importing model into unity
*uncheck conver units
*set rig's root node
*clip animations

get texture in unity:
*from import settings: export material and texture
*in the model's hiearchy view (the actual mesh),
	change the shader to unit/texture
